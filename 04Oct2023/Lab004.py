# print("Hello World !")
print("Naman","Singhal","is","a Student",sep="_",end='\n')
print("Hello Naman")

# print(self, *args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None)
# self - ignore for now - will be covered in OOPs concept
# *args - multiple number of arguments you can enter
# sep - seperator = space (by default)
# end - how you want to print after end
# file - will discuss this later
